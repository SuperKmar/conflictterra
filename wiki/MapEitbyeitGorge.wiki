  * CT Eitbyeit Gorge is a small map intended for one on one battles.  The first map ever made with the "CT style", it sat as a testing map due to it's small size.  It was pulled out for one on one's when the desire was made known for a small map.  Large meteor supplies are in the middle mountain, but side-by-side mining is dangerous!
  * Supports up to 2 players
  * 8 x 8
