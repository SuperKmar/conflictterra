== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bflyingmech.png]||Airborne "mech" designed to destroy cruisers.  Fires beam weapons and two AA missiles.  Cannot attack ground.||

The Fuma Aerial Combat Mech's main purpose is to destroy Cruisers.  It is armed with six beam weapons that deal higher damage to Cruisers than other aircraft.  It is also able to fire two anti-air missiles, which deal high damage to aircraft than Cruisers.  While somewhat expensive, they are quick units and quite capable of disposing of singled out Cruisers in small packs.  While the anti-air missiles provide some power against aircraft, they are not exceptionally strong, and should have some kind of proper back-up to truly be safe from roaming fighters.

== History ==
To some, the idea of a "flying mech" is an odd, or even dumb one.  I stand by this idea by arguing that mechs themselves are more implausible than plausible, and therefore do not have to abide by reason.  Also, a mech does not have to emulate a human or human shape.  In the very least, I can say that it does not resemble a conventional aircraft, and put the term "flying mech" in quotations, as a compromise to those who will continue to disagree.

The "bflyingmech" was a unit idea I was excited about very early on, and was among the first handful of units I modeled and textured.  Its design was something that changed quite a bit in my mind.  Originally, what I imagined was something more along the lines of the mechs found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech Robotech] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macross Macross], something that greatly resembled an aircraft but also had "humanoid elements."  Its funny that this is what I imagined, because I don't really enjoy either of those anime franchises.

But I soon decided that such a design would both be too blatantly a rip-off, and that I didn't really want the design anyways.  I turned next to my beloved Gundam, and began to draw emphasis from the Mobile Armours that populate that universe.  In particular I think what I drew from was the idea of a craft that didn't resemble an aircraft or a humanoid mech, but was its own entity.  What I came up with was a very angular machine that in many ways resembled the spacecraft found in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einhänder Playstation game Einhänder].  This game blew my mind in a lot of ways when I was young, and I think I was subconsciously channeling its design when modeling the Fuma.

Initially the plan was to have the mech's parts move and shift for a very animated appearance.  It would have landing and flying positions for its body and engines, and would help really bring it alive.  As usual, the reality was that I could not figure out how to do this.  To this day it sits very static, the only moving parts being the gun barrels of course.  The addition of LUPs did help bring a good deal of life to the unit.

An example of one of these poses is the "landed" form, pictured above.  The mech's engines rotated and the fuselage laid on its "back", the large back-mounted engine folding upwards over the head.  While this is a somewhat odd position for the unit, it was conceived in the days of making the mechs actually "work" in a real-world sense.  While that sensibility is still present, it is much weaker when in the face of getting units in-game and fun/memorable.

When the Fuma was to be flying, it would sort of lean forward headfirst, with the engines and guns rotating to accommodate this.  This pose was a more aggressive one, and I think would look well to make the units seem more alive.  It is still my desire to someday put these different poses into the unit, but that day may not come for a long time, not until someone can tell me how to do it.

== Name ==
The name Fuma was given to this unit because of its unique role of being a "flying mech."  I felt this implied a special, covert quality to the unit, and so I picked the name of one of the two great ninja clans from Japan, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fūma_Kotarō Fūma].  I chose the other clans name, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzō Hattori], for the Tech Level 2 flying mech, so I guess you could say I think less of the Fūma.  Indeed, their place in Japanese history and legend is lesser, but still something to note.  Ironically, the name Fūma means "Wind Demon", appropriate for this flying war machine.
