== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bheavyassaultmech.png]||Prototype SM designed to push SM technology to its limit.  Armed with powerful artillery and heavy cannons.||

The Izanagi Assault Mech is second to only one unit:  the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUesugiClassCruiser Uesugi Class Cruiser].  While the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUesugiClassCruiser Uesugi Class Cruiser] takes to the skies to bring destruction to all fronts, the Izanagi Assault Mech is restricted to the land, but can bring about heavy damage regardless.  Armed with a total of eight cannons, and the most heavily armored unit in the NKG arsenal, the Izanagi Assault Mech has one role:  to charge into the enemy base, and to keep going.  Using two heavier cannons mounted on the back to deal longer ranged damage, the Izanagi Assault Mech also has a total of six faster firing cannons to deal with closer units.  Its potential for damage is of course offset with a high price and complicated access.  Built at the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGExperimentalBuildPad Experimental Build Pad], a player must dedicate their economy to the development of this unit.

== History ==
The Izanagi is unique because it is the very first unit made _on whim._  That is, its the first unit I made and got in-game that wasn't in the original "plan" for the faction.  I had been toying with the idea of writing a story centered around mech combat around the time of this units conception--the earliest days of Conflict Terra.  The mech I was imagining in my head for this story is what you see today:  a reverse-joint styled leg setup holding up an angular "shark-like" head with a hefty array of weapons mounted on the sides and back.  The idea for this story was a more Americanized or Westernized portrayal of mech combat, a subject and genre so closely bound to Japanese portrayal and its culture's quirks.  The story was never realized, and never will be, but the idea lives on in this unit.

The earliest notions of this unit brewed up in leg designs.  I was seeking to expand on the then-still-fresh "reverse-joint" leg style.  I had already fully realized the style used extensively in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_core Armored Core] series, and was wanting to branch out.  My mind, oddly enough, went to Metal Gear Solid, specifically to the [http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Gekko Gekko] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gear_solid_4 Metal Gear Solid 4].  These odd machines had biological "legs", that were very sleek and nimble.  I sought to emulate this sleekness, as is obvious in the above sketches.  I was not happy with these drawings though, and after much tweaking I shifted from these feminine "high-heeled" legs to a sharply angled, armored leg.

From the legs I moved to the body, modeling the aforementioned "shark-like" body.  This general design can be seen in the game elsewhere in the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSaigaCombatSupportMech Saiga Combat Support Mech]; these two units bear very similar bodies.

I attached the weapons next, packing three guns onto each side.  I added the two heavier cannons on the back of the unit to help load the body down with weapons.

By the time I started animating this unit, I desired to create a better "reverse-joint" leg walking animation.  Completely stumped, I decided to closely watch how the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-ST#All_Terrain_Scout_Transport_.28AT-ST.29 AT-STs] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars Star Wars] walk.  Watching several Youtube videos of how the famous mechs walked, I realized that their hips pivot up and down on the z axis.  I tried to imitate this movement, but found I could not elegantly emulate this far-too-natural movement.  The experimental script sits in an old copy of the game to this day, waiting to be revisited and perhaps fixed, although it is unlikely.

The brown color scheme was given to the unit for a few reasons.  The largest reason is simply that I wasn't even sure if this game would go into the game.  It was honestly modeled and put together mostly "for fun"--like I said, it was not in the original plan.  So I decided to texture the unit the way I wanted to, ignoring my usual blue color scheme.  When I eventually decided to bring it into the game, I was not bothered by the brown color and decided it could be reasoned by being an "experimental" unit.  That is, it hasn't gotten its paint job yet!  I feel the brown has worked well, helping separate it on the battlefield from the other mechs and units.

== Name ==
Izanagi is a somewhat unique name for an NKG mech because it is not the name of a samurai or daimyo.  Its not even the name of a living person!  It is instead the name of a deity in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto Shint≈ç] creation story.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izanagi Izanagi] and his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izanami wife-sister] created the islands of Japan by dipping a spear into the ocean, and the drops that fell from the withdrawn blade created the islands.  I wanted this experimental unit, the ultimate in the NKG's mech line-up, to convey power, and I thought a deity was the best way to do this.  Izanagi is a name I've always thought sounded exotic and strong, and I feel it fits this unit rather well.
