== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bfightermkii.png]||Fast, light fighter armed with two air cannons.||

The Hayabusa Type Fighter fulfills one role and it fulfills well:  it is an air-superiority fighter.  Inexpensive, fast, and armed with a pair of aircraft-to-aircraft cannons, a squad of Hayabusa can make quick work of most aircraft.  Most players will find it prudent to have a handful of these units to help protect their airspace, and to possibly scout the enemy.  They are not the toughest aircraft out there, but they excel offensively.

They are only effective against aircraft and the flying mechs.  They do little damage to cruisers, requiring the use of [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSuzakuTypeFighter Suzaku Type Fighter MkIIIs].  However, they do well when mixed in with the Suzaku Type Fighter MkIIIs because they will be able to counter any other air-superiority fighters.

== History ==
The original fighter for the NKG was among the first units modeled and textured.  The initial design was an odd yet iconic one; it resembled the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Fighter#FF-X7_Core_Fighter Core Fighter] from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam Mobile Suit Gundam], in addition to relying on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canard_(aeronautics) canard] wing design used in early aircraft.

The first texture for the unit was among the first five textures I did for any units that would eventually be in CT.  Not yet deciding on a definitive color scheme, I purposely gave it a strong Core Fighter aesthetic just to see how it looked.  In the end, however, I was both not happy with it and not wanting to get too close to any particular mecha franchise in style.  After some time the color scheme for aircraft was decided to be a combination of light greys and white, and so the unit was retextured.

The bfighter proceeded to serve faithfully for a long time.  In time, however, I began to grow weary of the appearance of a lot of the aircraft for the NKG.  Eventually a massive overhaul of the aircraft began, and the bfighter couldn't escape it.

Despite the iconic design of the fighter, it was decided it too would receive a remodeling.  The biggest reason for this was simply that the canard wing design is apparently not a very maneuverable one, and so it would be stupid for the design of the workhorse anti-aircraft fighter to not be agile, regardless of the fact that it would have no bearing on actual gameplay.

However, finding a suitable replacement design was tough.  I tried looking for other unique aircraft designs in the real world, and didn't really find any that struck me as satsifying.  Ultimately I modeled a rather ordinary looking jet aircraft, incorporating a turbine on each wing and extra

== Name ==
Named after the infamous [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzō Hattori Hanzō] of the Hattori clan, the reason for giving this name was that the Hattori would be the ultimate in "special warfare".  Able to fly over any terrain, and deliver immense damage, the Hattori is much like the legends of its namesake.  The several Hattori Hanzōs of history have cultivated an immense cultural significance that persists to this day in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzo_(Kill_Bill) movies], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Samurai_Shodown_characters#Hanzo_Hattori video games], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_the_Assassin comic books].
