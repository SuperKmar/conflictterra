== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bassaultmech.png]||High powered SM armed with dual cannons and powerful beam weapons.||

The Honda Combat Mech MkII is a classic example of the "glass cannon."  It is a very powerful and deadly unit that is also very easy to kill.  Lightly armored, it is none-the-less swift and mobile, sharing the Jump Jet ability of its lesser cousin the Hojo Combat Mech.  Armed with two beam weapons that deal very high damage, the Honda Combat Mech MkII is most effective as a secondary force.  They won't last long on the front line, but if used strategically, can decimate an enemy force or base.  Their secondary weapons are two cannons, which while not very strong, will continue adding pressure on the enemy while the main beam weapons recharge.

Players should be careful though!  The beams remain firing for a full second, and will damage friendly units.  Clumsily used Honda Combat Mech MkIIs will kill each other and other friendlies rapidly with friendly fire.

Like the Hojo Combat Mech, the Honda Combat Mech MkII can Jump Jet over rough terrain and hostile enemies.  Their Jump Jet range is a little farther than the Hojo Combat Mech, as is their recharge rate.

== History ==
The original Honda Combat Mech differed quite a bit from what we now see as the Honda Combat Mech MkII.  Envisioned as a heavier and bulkier assault mech, it was more stout than what the unit would later become.  It was designed shortly after the Hojo Combat Mech, mostly because it was seen as a Tech Level 2 counterpart.

It was always intended to be armed with a beam weapon of some kind, a powerful weapon meant to punch through whatever resistance an enemy could muster.  When I imagined a weapon like th is, all I could think of was the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallgeese_III#Tallgeese Tallgeese III] from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_Wing:_Endless_Waltz Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz].  I always liked the beam cannon and how it worked:  a sort of extending and opening "fork" that launched energy as if on rails.  What I ended up modeling, however, was very boring and generic, and not fleshed out at all.  My friends referred to it as the "lobster unit."

With one of its arms housing the weapon, I was at a loss as to what to do with the other arm.  I couldn't give it _two_ of these powerful cannons, that would be overkill!  I finally decided on something I never liked:  to give it a large, round shield.  This immense, Greek-like protrusion never sat well with me.  I always felt it looked very out of place.  The shoulders I gave the unit, along with the "skirt armor", always made this unit look like it belonged in a robot Coliseum, not a post-modern battlefield.

None-the-less, the unit persisted as a difficult to balance Tech Level 2 mech.  Finally one day I decided enough was enough, and set out to remodel it.  I was going to redo the entire idea of the Honda, and make it a much swifter and deadlier foe.  When racking my brain for what would appear menacing in this way, I quickly came to one conclusion:  [http://armoredcore.wikia.com/wiki/Nineball Nineball].

The final mission in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core:_Master_of_Arena Armored Core:  Master of Arena] culminated in you fighting one of the most fearsome AC's to ever be in the series.  This customized AC (customized in that you could never obtain the parts it was made of) struck terror into my young heart, and was extremely difficult to defeat.  Amazingly fast and sometimes able to completely destroy you in seconds, it was everything I wanted this new unit to be.

I mirrored its large back-mounted thruster engines, and its overall nimble humanoid appearance.  For the new units weapons, I decided to fully realize what I intended for the original Honda, and made animated cannons like the Tallgeese III.  I once again ran into the conundrum of what to put on each arm, before deciding to just make a symmetrical mech with a combination of the beam weaponry and normal cannon on each arm.  This design was difficult to animate, and is difficult to see in-game, but is just more spice to the observant.

Balance of this new unit has been difficult, mostly due to its overwhelming power.  Eventually, it has settled into being reasonably destructive, and easy to eliminate.  A lower cost was given to it to help compensate the investment.

== Name ==
Honda was a name given purposely.  Inspired by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Tadakatsu Honda Tadakatsu], Tadakatsu is often portrayed as one of the finest warriors in medieval Japan.  Supposedly never being injured in the fifty-some battles he participated in, his spear, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonbogiri Tonbo giri], was said to be so sharp that a dragonfly would be split in two if it were to land on the blade.  The legends of Tadakatsu's immense prowess were a perfect match-up with this unit that was always intended to be a heavy hitter.
