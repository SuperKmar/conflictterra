= Conflict Terra Map Policy =

We want Conflict Terra to be playable on virtually any map, so that players can have as much fun, and any kind of fun, that they want.  Unfortunately, at the moment Conflict Terra can only be played on maps that have proper lua scripts to spawn mineable rocks at the beginning of a game.  Hopefully, one day the actual content of the game will be able to do this, and Conflict Terra will be playable on any map.

We decided that our policy towards community maps for the game is that if you put the proper lua in the map, and put "CT" at the beginning of the map name, we're okay with what you make.  You can go with whatever visual style you want, that is up to you.  The development team will continue to make maps in the style you've seen.

Here are some links to some guides to help you make your own Conflict Terra map, if you'd wish to do so.

= "Official" Conflict Terra Maps =

These maps are made by the development team, specifically Oksnoop2, who embraces the map-making side of Spring.

== CT_Eureka ==

  * CT_Eureka is a relatively open map that is broken up by small hills.  Pine trees dot the lowlands, and an occasional boulder gives a strong alpine feeling to the map.
  * Supports up to 8 players
  * 16 x 16
  * Map Options to evenly disperse starting rocks over map, or to only spawn them on the hills.

== CT_Fishbone_Ridge ==

  * CT_Fishbone_Ridge is an interesting map.  A spine-like ridge runs through the middle, with initial starting spots in small canyons jutting from the ridge.  Cacti and boulders stand in this desert battleground.
  * Supports up to 13 players
  * 20 x 10
  * Map Options to evenly disperse starting rocks over map, only on the "ridge" of the map, or to only spawn them in the "lowlands".
