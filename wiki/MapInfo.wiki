= Note for Players =

While Conflict Terra will try to make any non-CT map playable by spawning mine-able resources according to the metal map, this does not always give the best results. 
So for the best experience you should play an [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/MapInfo#"Official"_Conflict_Terra_Maps official map], prefixed with CT.

We also have a growing list of non-CT maps by the community that have configuration files which allow them to have unique resource layouts.  A list of these maps can be found [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/MapInfo#Non-CT_Maps_with_Defined_Resource_Placement here].  

= Conflict Terra Map Policy =

We decided that our policy towards community maps for the game is that if you put the proper lua in the map, and put "CT" at the beginning of the map name, we're okay with what you make.  You can go with whatever visual style you want, that is up to you.  The development team will continue to make maps in the style you've seen.

= Links =

Here are some links to some guides to help you make your own Conflict Terra map, if you'd wish to do so.

= "Official" Conflict Terra Maps =

These maps are made by the development team, specifically Oksnoop2, who embraces the map-making side of Spring.

== CT Eureka ==

  * CT_Eureka is a relatively open map that is broken up by small hills.  Pine trees dot the lowlands, and an occasional boulder gives a strong alpine feeling to the map.
  * Supports up to 8 players
  * 16 x 16

== CT Fishbone Ridge ==

  * CT_Fishbone_Ridge is an interesting map.  A spine-like ridge runs through the middle, with initial starting spots in small canyons jutting from the ridge.  Cacti and boulders stand in this desert battleground.
  * Supports up to 13 players
  * 20 x 10

== CT Tumblebrush Basin ==

  * CT_Tumblebrush_Basin is a large basin where fighting ignites most often in the middle of the map.  The flat bottom of the basin appears barren at first, but it is actually filled with cacti, flowering barrel cacti, tumbleweed, and even has a few hoodoos.  Some say a strange plant grows high in the hills there, a hybrid plant called tumblebrush!
  * Supports up to 10 players
  * 16 x 16

= Non-CT Maps with Defined Resource Placement =
Besides placing resources via the metal map, Conflict Terra also contains configuration files for more detailed placement of resources.

So far Conflict Terra includes configuration files for the following Spring maps:

  * KochCanyon-v02
  * MoonQ20x
  * Terra
  * TitanDuel
  * Trench_Linked
  * Valley Of Unrest V3
  * Victoria Crater
  * Seths_Ravine

Thanks to all mappers who originally made these nice maps :)
