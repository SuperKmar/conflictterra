== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bantitankmech.png]||Slightly old cloakable SM model built to destroy tanks.  Fires two armor piercing rounds.||

The Enkei Combat Support Mech is a somewhat hardier mech designed to counter tanks.  Sporting a little more HP than the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUedaCombatSupportMech Ueda Combat Support Mech], it is armored to deal with its beefier foes.  It fires two shells that do substantial damage to tanks and vehicles, but it does not reload very quickly.  Due to its slower reload time, it is not very good at destroying buildings and other units.  The Enkei Combat Support Mech has the ability to cloak itself.  This prevents enemy players from seeing the unit, but it is still visible to radar!  It uses 5 energy per second to maintain this cloaked state.

It works well with the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUedaCombatSupportMech Ueda Combat Support Mech], an anti-mech unit.

Coming soon!

== History ==
The existence of this unit is quite a bit shorter than most of the other mechs.  Modeled and created long after the game went public, its role as an anti-tank unit was finally decided to be too important to ignore.  Afterall, up to that point the only two anti-tank units were the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSaigaCombatSupportMech Saiga Combat Support Mech] and the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGWashiTypeWarplane Washi Type Warplane]!

Its design was somewhat rushed, and draws heavily from the look of the mechs of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core Armored Core], with the quadruped leg style and long barreled guns as arms.  The torso was also inspired by the Core part (the torso) used by [http://armoredcore.wikia.com/wiki/Nineball Nineball] in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core_(video_game) original Armored Core].

It did not start out being able to cloak.  The cloak ability was part of the "reform" to give the mechs special "abilities" to help set them apart from their tank counter-parts.  The thinking behind the cloak ability was that these mechs were like hunters, stalking the poor tanks and picking them off with guerrilla type tactics.  Cloaking of course played well with this.

== Name ==
The name Enkei was actually the result of some slight tampering.  I took the given name of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankokuji_Ekei Ankokuji Ekei] and added an n to make it resemble the name of a Pokemon, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entei Entei].  Ekei was of little importance to Japanese history, and is perhaps best known as a pivotal character in the Playstation 2 game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onimusha_2 Onimusha 2:  Samurai's Destiny], where he is a master spear fighter and an ally of the main character, Jubei.  Incidentally, enkei (円形) is also the Japanese word for circle.
