= Introduction =

This is intended to be a glossary of terms for Conflict Terra.  When coming up with descriptions, and talking about elements of the game, we naturally started using specific terms.  While a lot of the terms will no doubt retain their conventional meaning, we discovered that some of the connotations we saw in certain words did not translate into how others saw the game, and confusion arose.  This page is intended to help combat that confusion.

= A =

=== Anti-Mech ===
For the NKG, while the name is pretty self-explanatory, it specifically means a unit is designed to deal higher damage to mechs.  All Anti-Mech units fire missiles, but not all missile units are Anti-Mech units.

=== Artillery ===
For the NKG, artillery units are specifically units that deal high damage to buildings, although not all units that deal high damage to buildings are considered artillery.  They are often times long-ranged, although it should not be counted on.

=== Assault ===
For the NKG, units that use the term assault are generally meant to be offensive units.  This means that they are intended to be used to take land or strategic areas, and usually deal sufficient to high damage.  It does _not_ mean they are especially well-armored, or should be on the front line.  It merely means they do better at taking bases than defending them.

= B =

=== Beam Weapon ===
For the NKG, the definition of beam weaponry closely reflects the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Century_technology#Mega-particle_cannon Mega Particle] weaponry of the Universal Century timeline of Gundam, just without the science backing it up.  Some may call the beam weapons they see in Conflict Terra "lasers", but I dislike this term because a laser is just light.  The beam weapons used by the NKG are closer to a type of plasma, burning very hot and able to be shot as a projectile.  For in-game users, the beam weapons tend to be used by more advanced units, although some units that use beam weapons aren't particularly special.  It was usually a cosmetic choice to give a unit a beam weapon.

= C =

=== Cannon ===
For the NKG, the term cannon is used to describe a generic "gun" type weapon.  Firing some kind of shell, cannons are often not the fastest weapon types, but not the slowest either.  Their damage is also not especially high, but are decent.  In short, most cannons are very average and middle-of-the-spectrum weapons in most ways.

=== Cloak ===
The Cloak ability makes units invisible to enemy players, but the Cloaked unit is still susceptible to being picked up by radar.  Most Cloaked units require Energy to maintain the state, although that is not always the case.  It should also be noted that Cloaked units will be detected if they go to close to enemy units.

=== Cruiser ===
Large flying "ships" for the NKG, Cruisers are a staple of the NKG and are necessary for any NKG player.  They serve many roles, with some being factories to produce other units such as mechs and tanks, and some being simple battle units.  They are not spacecraft, and shouldn't be confused with that despite their stereotypical "spacecraft" appearance.

= D =

=== Drones ===
Coming Soon.

= E =

=== Energy ===
Energy is one of the two resources in Conflict Terra.  Obtained primarily through building buildings whose sole purpose is to create Energy, the resource is mostly used as a limiting factor on a player, requiring them to build an adequate Energy economy in order to expand.  Every unit requires Energy to be built, and all Energy and Metal values are the same.

For the NKG, it is also used by radar towers to function; if the player has exhausted their Energy, the radar towers will stop functioning.

= H =

=== Hover ===
For the NKG, a hover unit means that the unit is able to travel over water just as if it were land, and move between the two seamlessly.  Unlike some Total Annihilation derived games where "hovers" are a group of units in and of themselves, the NKG's hover units are mixed in with the other unit groups, and any per-conceived notion about the hover units should not be carried into the game.

= L =

=== Light ===
For the NKG, a light unit essentially means that the unit either does low damage, has low HP, or a combination of the two.  It does not always mean the unit is especially fast, although it is sometimes the case.

= M =

=== Metal ===
One of the two resources in Conflict Terra, Metal is obtained primarily through mining meteorites on the map.  Another way to obtain Metal is to reclaim wrecked units.  On some maps, ones not made by the Conflict Terra Team, some features can be reclaimed for Metal as well, although that could affect the state of balance in the game.  Metal is used to build buildings and units, and all Metal and Energy values are the same.

=== Meteorite ===
A meteorite is any mine-able "rock" on the map.  There are two main types of meteorites:  meteorites that spawn on the map at the start of the game, and meteorites that fall to the map and crash throughout the course of a game.  Your miners, when told to do so, will seek out these meteorites.

=== Miner ===
A miner is any unit that can "mine" meteorites on the map to obtain Metal for their player.

= N =

=== Nihon Kadousei Guntai ===
The Nihon Kadousei Guntai is the full name for the often abbreviated NKG.  It is Japanese for "Japanese Mobile Forces."  The kanji for the name is:  日本可動性軍隊.

= P =

=== PN ===
Coming Soon.

= S =

=== Sentou Meka ===
SM for short, Sentou Meka is the full and "official" name of the type of mechs used by the NKG.  Japanese for "combat mech", the SM are essentially large mechanical combat vehicles, usually resembling the human figure to at least some abstract degree, although not always.  They are generally more expensive, faster, and hit harder than NKG tanks, although they also are generally destroyed quicker.

=== Siege ===
For the NKG, units specified as "siege" units specifically deal high damage to buildings.  Essentially the same as the term Artillery.

=== Stealth ===
Stealth units are visible to the enemy, but will not show up on radar.  Stealth units do not require any sort of Energy maintenance, and the Stealth state can not be turned off or on; it is always on.
