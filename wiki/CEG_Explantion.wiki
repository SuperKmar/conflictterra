= CEGs =

The unit script lists the cegs it uses. As seen here:

http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/games/CT/units/bbasicmech.lua

Code: 

{{{

 sfxtypes            = {
        
            explosiongenerators = {
                "custom:orc_machinegun_flash",
                "custom:orc_machinegun_muzzle",
                "custom:buildersparks",
            },
        
          }, 

}}}

As you can see the buildersparks are third on the list. I'm pointing that out because the order matters. 

Next we look at the script here:

http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/games/CT/scripts/bbasicmech.lua

Code:

{{{

        --signals
        local SIG_AIM = 1
        local SIG_AIM_SEC = 2
        local walk_go = 4
        local walk_stop = 8
        local jumpjet_SIG = 16
        local orc_machinegun_flash = SFX.CEG
        local orc_machinegun_muzzle = SFX.CEG + 1
        local jumpjetsfx = SFX.CEG + 2

}}}

    Here we can see that local jumpjetsfx = SFX.CEG + 2. The significance of this is important. If you look up at the unitdef you see that the builderspark is third in the list. So it get's the designation SFX.CEG + 2. Kind of silly because it's third in the list but just remember that the SFX.CEG + # is always one behind it's number on the list in the unitdef.

    So that is how the jumpjetsfx is call the buildspark CEG located here:
