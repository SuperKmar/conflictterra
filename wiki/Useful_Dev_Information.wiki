= Rough Scale =

For Conflict Terra, we've trained to maintain a relative scale between units.  Things are not exactly to scale, simply because units such as the Flagship would have to be quite massive.  In general, the mechs are intended to be a little smaller than the sort of usual mech scale (such as the scale in Gundam.)  The Hojo Combat Mech is somewhere in the 25 foot range.  Here is an image of the rough scale.
