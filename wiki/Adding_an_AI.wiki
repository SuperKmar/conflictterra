= What AI Should I Pick? =

At the moment, three AI work well enough with Conflict Terra to be playable against.  These include:
  * *RAI 0.601*
  A relatively easy to play against AI, that comes packaged with the Spring installer.  Builds slowly, and should provide a good environment to get more familiar with the game.
  * *E323AI 3.22.3*
  A very aggressive AI that is difficult to play against, this would provide more of a challenge.  This AI also comes packaged with the Spring installer.
  * *Shard*
  Being developed by AF, Shard is an easy to configure AI.  We provide [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/#svn/AIconfigs/shard/ct configuration] files, but you can write your own and try to make a more challenging AI!
