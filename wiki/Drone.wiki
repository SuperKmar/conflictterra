==*The Drone Faction*==


     The Drones are a simple faction with several units that can clone themselves to create a massive army capable of destruction on a broad scale. Little is known about their origins other than that they are a robot-like alien civilization attacking earth in search of metal. They must harvest earth and destroy all in their way to continue their existence.
