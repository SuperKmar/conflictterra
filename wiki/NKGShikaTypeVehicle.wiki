== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bscoutvehicle.png]||Quick, cheap, unarmed reconnaissance vehicle.  Radar equipped.||

Like the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHashibaScoutMech Hashiba Scout Mech], the Shika Type Vehicle is purely a reconnaissance unit.  Unarmed and not particularly hardy, this units only role is to scout areas and observe your enemies.  It is equipped with radar that is equal to its Line of Sight, to help it detect cloaked units.

It should be noted that it does NOT share the ability to build Camera Towers, like the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHashibaScoutMech Hashiba Scout Mech].  That is unique to that particular unit.

It differs from the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHashibaScoutMech Hashiba Scout Mech] in that it is even cheaper, and has more HP, but is also a little slower and its Line of Sight is not as far.  Despite this, it is still a viable intelligence unit.

== History ==
This unit sort of evolved from an earlier unit, that is now of course no longer in the game.  You could say the Shika came from the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUremeTypeRadarTank Ureme Type Radar Tank].  The "radar units" were deemed to be ineffective and unexciting, so their very function was redesigned into the "scout units."  The [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUremeTypeRadarTank Ureme Type Radar Tank] thus turned into the Shika Type Vehicle.

It was decided that the new scout-type vehicle would not be a type of tank, for it was desired to be exceptionally fast on the ground.  A few ideas were thrown around for a motorcycle or buggy design, and the buggy-like idea stuck.  When trying to think of how to make the new unit exciting, my mind went to some kind of external suspension linking the wheels to the chasis of the vehicle.  What I came up with resembled a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_car RC car], somewhat humorously.  The uncanny similiarity to the RC car in the movie [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_story Toy Story] was quickly noticed, and the unit has since been affectionately known to always be searching for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear Buzz].

While the unit has "suspension" as part of its model, it does not exhibit any actual suspension properties in-game.  We're not even really sure if this is possible.

== Name ==
Shika is the Japanese word for "deer".  The name deer was given to the unit for its required swiftness, with the word for horse already being taken by the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUmaTypeHoverTruck Uma Type Hover Truck].
