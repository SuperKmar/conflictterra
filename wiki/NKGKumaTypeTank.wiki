The Kuma Type Tank is the Tech Level 1 dedicated Anti-mech unit for the tank lineup.  Firing a pair of arcing Anti-mech missiles, the unit is most effective when fighting mechs.  Being a little more expensive than the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGOukamiTypeTank Oukami Type Tank], it is not the best unit to send into a base if you're unsure of what the enemy has, or you know they do not have many mechs.

They work well when grouped with [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGOukamiTypeTank Oukami Type Tanks].

Because the Kuma Type Tank fires arcing missiles, a player can effectively use cover to damage an enemy while keeping safe.

== History ==
Although modeled shortly after the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGOukamiTypeTank Oukami Type Tank], there is not much to tell about this unit.  It was produced in a one shot spurt of modeling, bearing a simple design of a central turret with a missile launching pod on each side.  This being the first missile unit made, it was where I began the trend of putting dots on the faces expected to launch missiles, to mirror a dense honeycomb of missiles.  This method was (much) later abandoned as it was shoddy and did not look good.

The unit originally fired missiles that did not arc.  It was finally decided that arcing missiles would help alleviate the problem of front-line units being fired upon by their allies, and this change was applied to most missile units.

At one point in the game's history, the Kuma was so cheap and effective that a player could spam them and give their opponent a hard time, much like the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUkitaHoverCombatMech Ukita Hover Combat Mech].  This has of course been balanced.

== Name ==
Kuma is the Japanese word for "bear", the term given mostly because it seemed logical for a military unit to have the name of a bear.  The name fits the unit well.
