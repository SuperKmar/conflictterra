#summary Alternate Mech Unit guide

= Introduction =

This is a guide to the Combat Mechs available to the NKG in Conflict Terra. The NKG Mechs are overall designed to be lightly armored, fast, hard-hitting units that can dish out a lot of damage quickly, but can't take a whole lot themselves. Intended more for offensive situations than defensive ones, the Mech units have a fun line-up.
