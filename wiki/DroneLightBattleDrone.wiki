=*Light Battle Drone*=

The Light Battle Drone is the brother to the Drone Warrior. Though it is weaker in hit points and damage, the Light Battle Drone is half the cost, and is a great starting unit to defend and scout with. Clone this drone a few times and you have a force to be reckoned with in the field.
