= Introduction =
The unitname of the startressource is: bminerals
After balance, testing etc. is done it should not be changed anymore.
This page explains how to add start minerals to your map.

[http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/map%20resources/LuaRules/Gadgets/tp_ressources.lua The gadget that spawns starting minerals for a map.]

Scroll down to
*GameStart()*
There you find this:
{{{
SpawnRessourceField (3900,1900, 3, 300)
SpawnRessourceField (2250,2300, 2, 300)
SpawnRessource (1800,2500)
SpawnRessource (2500,2700)
SpawnRessource (3650,1400)
SpawnRessource (4360,1600)
SpawnRessourceField (770,3630, 2, 250)
SpawnRessourceField (5150,480, 2, 250)
}}}


*SpawnRessource (x,y)*
Spawns a single bminerals at x:y coordinates

*SpawnRessourceField (x,y, n, spread)*
Spawns n minerals at x:y coordinates spread over an area.
Spread = how far away from x:y rocks are spawned (randomly)

Delete all the SpawnRessource function calls and add your own or just change the numbers.
The coordinates are the same as the ones you see ingame in the tooltip.

Of course if you feel experienced with Lua you can also make complex stuff and write your own functions.


==Map Options==
Maps can also have options to change all kind of things
For example change the waterlevel or different weather.
Here is an [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/map+resources/MapOptions.lua example] that adds a custom "rocklayout" list parameter and spawns resources depending on the chosen preset.
