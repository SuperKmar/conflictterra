= Introduction =
This page explains how to add start minerals to your map.<br>
Mappers can define where they want to place mineable resources on the map with a simple config file.
This is preferable for mappers who want not to rely on a <not yet added> function that will automagically place rocks at gamestart.
For a TA map, you would not want your metal or geo spots placed by some script either, would you?

The unitname of the startressource is: bminerals<br>
After balance, testing etc. is done it should not be changed anymore.<br>
At the moment it is worth 500 metal and a worker can carry 25 metal.<br>

= Technical Details =
There is a gadget: tp_resourcespawner.lua
It looks for a map confile filed with the name of:<br>
MAPNAME_res.lua<br>
This map file returns a table of rock positions, the gadget reads these positions and then places them.<br>
This is different to the old way, where the map would try to spawn the rocks itself, causing problems if the mod did no have a "bminerals" unit etc.


= Details =
Here are some example configs:<br>
http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/#svn/games/CT/mapconfigs

The Lua is the same for configs that are included in the map.<br>

A map with a rock layout file:<br>
http://www.file-upload.net/download-2966227/CT_Testgebiet.sd7.html<br>
Open up the CT_Testgebiet_res.lua file<br>
NOTE: rename it to fit your own map name!<br>
ie MyCoolMap_res.lua

It is adviced to use this map as an example instead of Eureka or Fishbone Ridge.<br>
They both do work but there are some problems with their Lua.<br>
For example their Lua directly spawns the rocks via Spring.CreateUnit ("bminerals")<br>
Of course this causes problems if the mod does not have such a unit.

---coordinates go in between here---<br>

SpawnResource (2042 , 3482)   -- <br>

---coordinates go in between here---<br><br>


Change the numbers to where you want rocks to appear at gamestart.<br>
The coordinates are the same as displayed in Spring's ingame tooltip.<br>
Do not touch the other stuff in the file unless you know what you are doing.<br>
In this case experiments are encouraged :) <br>
Eitherwise please note that a faulty res.lua file will not stop your map from loading but no rocks will be spawned or errors might appear in the console.

= Coordinate Helper Widget =
[http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/games/CT/luaui/widgets/tp_coordinate_help.lua?spec=svn686&r=686 Coordinate Helper Widget]<br>

Press F11 and enable it.<br>
Every time you put down a marker it will log its position in infolog.txt and also
in MAPNAME_coordinates.txt<br>
You can then copy the coordinates into your maps config file.<br>
NOTE: if you enter a text for the marker it will also be logged.<br>
It is probally a good idea to "name" your rocks so you do not get confused.<br>
ie like you see in the example above.<br>

= Map Options & Advanced Stuff =
Maps are not limited to return a static rocklayout.<br>
You could put in conditions, etc. and place more rocks based on player number or scan your heightmap for hills higher than X and only put rocks there.<br>
Or example you could return different rock layouts (res tables) based on a choice made from mapoptions. Or add more rocks if player number > 2.<br>

This will be explained in depth later, if you are somewhat familiar with Lua you can probably figure it out. <br>
If you have a special idea/trouble with your map you can also ask Knorke.<br>
