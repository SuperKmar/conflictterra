== Description ==
A natural labyrinth high in the mountains, CT Pathwinder lies in the midst of a pine forest surrounded by towering mountains.  Sometimes opening into large flats, and sometimes narrowing down into dead ends, CT Pathwinder is for the wary.  The remaining Giant Sequoias on the planet grow in this highland grove, standing vigil as the lesser pines around them guard their enormous trunks.

== Tactics ==
Like a bigger, badder [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/MapEurekaCT Eureka], this map is divided into two levels: the low ground and the high ground.  

  * Tanks can climb only two of the plateaus on the map.
  * Mechs can climb all of the plateaus on the map.

Players can hide small bases in the dead end ravines, or build great fortresses in the open junctions.  Caution is the name of the game here, as player movement is greatest around the edge of the map.

== History ==
Made quickly and with little announcement, CT Pathwinder is distinguished as one of the largest CT maps to date.  It was made as an attempt to narrow gameplay down into valleys as opposed to open plains.  The result was the labyrinth-like terrain.

It was also the first map to feature the Giant Sequoia feature.  Like the map itself, the feature was made on whim, in an attempt to work in more tree types.  It was thought a giant tree would make for a nice spectacle, and originally the tree was set to scale with the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHojoCombatMech Hojo Combat Mech], which stands at around 25 feet.  This made the tree absolutely massive, to the point that it dwarfed the "large" units like the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGCruiserHub Cruisers].  The tree was then cut down to a little bit less than half its size, which is where it stands today.
