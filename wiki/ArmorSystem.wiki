= Summary =

Conflict Terra utilizes a simple Armor System to give a more dynamic spin on combat.  The Armor System is simple in that each weapon in the game has the potential to deal different damage to each armor type in the game.  This differs from the somewhat more traditional armor systems found in RTS, where weapons or attacks gain a multiplier bonus against armors that they are strong against.

Our system is born almost entirely out of a desire for simplicity and, to be blunt, a lack of knowhow as to how to implement a more complicated Armor System, such as can be found in other Spring games like Gundam RTS and Evolution RTS.

= Armor Classes =

There are 7 Armor Classes.  Each unit can only belong to one Armor Class.  Sometimes if a unit can morph, it will morph into a unit with a different Armor Class.  We strive to make identification intuitive, but here is a chart to lay everything out for you.  You can also view the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/games/CT/gamedata/armordefs.lua armordefs.lua] to identify the Armor Classes.
