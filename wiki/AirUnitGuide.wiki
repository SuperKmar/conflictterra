This is a guide to the air units in Conflict Terra.

    The Tori Type Fighter is the most basic aircraft available to the NKG.  Swift and quickly built, the Tori Type Fighter is armed with four machine cannons designed to shoot down other aircraft, which they do rather well.  Not able to take much damage themselves, they're ideal for dispersing bothersome raids from the skies.

=Ure Type Bomber=

    The Ure Type Bomber is a basic, small bomber.  While not as swift or fragile as the Tori Type Fighter, the Ure Type Bomber can attack the ground with a small payload of bombs.  The bombs fall in a small area, so they are ideal for destroying buildings, but they are not overwhelmingly effective.  The bombers rely on fuel, so their range of deployment is limited by the placement of airfields.

=Washi Type Warplane=

   The Washi Type Warplane is an aircraft armed with four missiles designed to only attack land units.  Doing very little damage to buildings, they are intended to destroy enemy units.  While not especially powerful overall, they do deal a little more damage to tanks.  Unlike the bombers, the Washi Type Warplane does not rely on fuel so its potential for deployment is infinitively better than that of the Ure Type Bomber.

=Kangae Type Radar Plane=

    The Kangae Type Radar Plane is a first generation reconnaissance aircraft for the NKG.  Unarmed, but equipped with a rotating radar dish built into the fuselage, the Kangae Type Radar Plane is able to detect any enemy units not sneaky enough to be stealthy or jamming radar.  Due to their high altitude flight patterns, they are able to only see units directly below them.
