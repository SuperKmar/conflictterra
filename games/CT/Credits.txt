- Virtually all modelling, texturing, unit def creation and animation for the NKG is done by Sanada.  badvjammertower.s3o was modeled by Oksnoop2, and various balance changes were also done by him.

- Credit for work on refining elements of the game (gadgets, and widgets) along with creating maps, and a general liason with the Spring Community goes to Oksnoop2.

- Thanks to Flozi and Forboding Angel for helping to get alternating fire figured out for the units.

- Thanks to Knorke for developing and getting the new metal economy going.  The mining and falling meteors are his work.

- Thanks to zwzsg for writing the Spread'n'Morph gadget that allowed the AI to morph units.  Huge step in making Conflict Terra AI friendly!

- Sounds in the sound folder /argh done by Argh.  Most were leveled by Nightcold.
